<span>Then said a rich man, "Speak to us of Giving."</span>
And he answered:</span>
<span>You give but little when you give of your possessions.</span>
<span>It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.</span>
<span>For what are your possessions but things you keep and guard for fear you may need them tomorrow?</span>
<span>And tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bring to the over prudent dog burying bones in the trackless sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city?</span>
<span>And what is fear of need but need itself?</span>
<span>Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, thirst that is unquenchable?</span>
<span>There are those who give little of the much which they have - and they give it for recognition and their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.</span>
<span>And there are those who have little and give it all.</span>
<span>These are the believers in life and the bounty of life, and their coffer is never empty.</span>
<span>There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward.</span>
<span>And there are those who give with pain, and that pain is their baptism.</span>
<span>And there are those who give and know not pain in giving, nor do they seek joy, nor give with mindfulness of virtue;</span>
<span>They give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes its fragrance into space.</span>
<span>Through the hands of such as these God speaks, and from behind their eyes He smiles upon the earth.</span>
<span>It is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through understanding;</span>
<span>And to the open-handed the search for one who shall receive is joy greater than giving</span>
<span>And is there aught you would withhold?</span>
<span>All you have shall some day be given;</span>
<span>Therefore give now, that the season of giving may be yours and not your inheritors'.</span>
<span>You often say, "I would give, but only to the deserving."</span>
<span>The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the flocks in your pasture.</span>
<span>They give that they may live, for to withhold is to perish.</span>
<span>Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and his nights is worthy of all else from you.</span>
<span>And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream.</span>
<span>And what desert greater shall there be than that which lies in the courage and the confidence, nay the charity, of receiving?</span>
<span>And who are you that men should rend their bosom and unveil their pride, that you may see their worth naked and their pride unabashed?</span>
<span>See first that you yourself deserve to be a giver, and an instrument of giving.</span>
<span>For in truth it is life that gives unto life - while you, who deem yourself a giver, are but a witness.</span>
<span>And you receivers - and you are all receivers - assume no weight of gratitude, lest you lay a yoke upon yourself and upon him who gives.</span>
<span>Rather rise together with the giver on his gifts as on wings;</span>
<span>For to be over mindful of your debt, is to doubt his generosity who has the free-hearted earth for mother, and God for father.</span>
