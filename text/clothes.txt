<span>And the weaver said, "Speak to us of Clothes."</span>
<span>And he answered:</span>
<span>Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.</span>
<span>And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.</span>
<span>Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment,</span>
<span>For the breath of life is in the sunlight and the hand of life is in the wind.</span>
<span>Some of you say, "It is the north wind who has woven the clothes to wear."</span>
<span>But shame was his loom, and the softening of the sinews was his thread.</span>
<span>And when his work was done he laughed in the forest.</span>
<span>Forget not that modesty is for a shield against the eye of the unclean.</span>
<span>And when the unclean shall be no more, what were modesty but a fetter and a fouling of the mind?</span>
<span>And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.</span>
