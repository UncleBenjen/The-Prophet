<span>Then an old man, a keeper of an inn, said, "Speak to us of Eating and Drinking."</span>
<span>And he said:</span>
<span>Would that you could live on the fragrance of the earth, and like an air plant be sustained by the light.</span>
<span>But since you must kill to eat, and rob the young of its mother's milk to quench your thirst, let it then be an act of worship,</span>
And let your board stand an altar on which the pure and the innocent of forest and plain are sacrificed for that which is purer and <span>still more innocent in many.</span>
<span>When you kill a beast say to him in your heart,</span>
<span>"By the same power that slays you, I too am slain; and I too shall be consumed.</span>
<span>For the law that delivered you into my hand shall deliver me into a mightier hand.</span>
<span>Your blood and my blood is naught but the sap that feeds the tree of heaven."</span>
<span>And when you crush an apple with your teeth, say to it in your heart,</span>
<span>"Your seeds shall live in my body,</span>
<span>And the buds of your tomorrow shall blossom in my heart,</span>
<span>And your fragrance shall be my breath,</span>
<span>And together we shall rejoice through all the seasons."</span>
<span>And in the autumn, when you gather the grapes of your vineyard for the winepress, say in your heart,</span>
<span>"I too am a vineyard, and my fruit shall be gathered for the winepress,</span>
<span>And like new wine I shall be kept in eternal vessels."</span>
<span>And in winter, when you draw the wine, let there be in your heart a song for each cup;</span>
<span>And let there be in the song a remembrance for the autumn days, and for the vineyard, and for the winepress.</span>
