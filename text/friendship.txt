<span>And a youth said, "Speak to us of Friendship."</span>
<span>And he answered, saying:</span>
<span>Your friend is your needs answered.</span>
<span>He is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving.</span>
<span>And he is your board and your fireside.</span>
<span>For you come to him with your hunger, and you seek him for peace.</span>
<span>When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."</span>
<span>And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;</span>
<span>For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.</span>
<span>When you part from your friend, you grieve not;</span>
<span>For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.</span>
<span>And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.</span>
<span>For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.</span>
<span>And let your best be for your friend.</span>
<span>If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.</span>
<span>For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?</span>
<span>Seek him always with hours to live.</span>
<span>For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.</span>
<span>And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.</span>
<span>For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.</span>
