<span>Then a lawyer said, "But what of our Laws, master?"</span>
<span>And he answered:</span>
<span>You delight in laying down laws,</span>
<span>Yet you delight more in breaking them.</span>
<span>Like children playing by the ocean who build sand-towers with constancy and then destroy them with laughter.</span>
<span>But while you build your sand-towers the ocean brings more sand to the shore,</span>
<span>And when you destroy them, the ocean laughs with you.</span>
<span>Verily the ocean laughs always with the innocent.</span>
<span>But what of those to whom life is not an ocean, and man-made laws are not sand-towers,</span>
<span>But to whom life is a rock, and the law a chisel with which they would carve it in their own likeness?</span>
<span>What of the cripple who hates dancers?</span>
<span>What of the ox who loves his yoke and deems the elk and deer of the forest stray and vagrant things?</span>
<span>What of the old serpent who cannot shed his skin, and calls all others naked and shameless?</span>
<span>And of him who comes early to the wedding-feast, and when over-fed and tired goes his way saying that all feasts are violation and all feasters law-breakers?</span>
<span>What shall I say of these save that they too stand in the sunlight, but with their backs to the sun?</span>
<span>They see only their shadows, and their shadows are their laws.</span>
<span>And what is the sun to them but a caster of shadows?</span>
<span>And what is it to acknowledge the laws but to stoop down and trace their shadows upon the earth?</span>
<span>But you who walk facing the sun, what images drawn on the earth can hold you?</span>
<span>You who travel with the wind, what weathervane shall direct your course?</span>
<span>What man's law shall bind you if you break your yoke but upon no man's prison door?</span>
<span>What laws shall you fear if you dance but stumble against no man's iron chains?</span>
<span>And who is he that shall bring you to judgment if you tear off your garment yet leave it in no man's path?</span>
<span>People of Orphalese, you can muffle the drum, and you can loosen the strings of the lyre, but who shall command the skylark not to sing?</span>
