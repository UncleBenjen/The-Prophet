<span>Then Almitra spoke, saying, "We would ask now of Death."</span>
<span>And he said:</span>
<span>You would know the secret of death.</span>
<span>But how shall you find it unless you seek it in the heart of life?</span>
<span>The owl whose night-bound eyes are blind unto the day cannot unveil the mystery of light.</span>
<span>If you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life.</span>
<span>For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one.</span>
<span>In the depth of your hopes and desires lies your silent knowledge of the beyond;</span>
<span>And like seeds dreaming beneath the snow your heart dreams of spring.</span>
<span>Trust the dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.</span>
<span>Your fear of death is but the trembling of the shepherd when he stands before the king whose hand is to be laid upon him in honour.</span>
<span>Is the shepherd not joyful beneath his trembling, that he shall wear the mark of the king?</span>
<span>Yet is he not more mindful of his trembling?</span>
<span>For what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun?</span>
<span>And what is it to cease breathing, but to free the breath from its restless tides, that it may rise and expand and seek God unencumbered?</span>
<span>Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing.</span>
<span>And when you have reached the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb.</span>
<span>And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance.</span>
