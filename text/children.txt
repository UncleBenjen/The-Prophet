<p>
<span>And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, "Speak to us of Children."</span>
<span>And he said:</span>
<span>Your children are not your children.</span>
<span>They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.</span>
<span>They come through you but not from you,</span>
<span>And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.</span>
<span>You may give them your love but not your thoughts.</span>
<span>For they have their own thoughts.</span>
<span>You may house their bodies but not their souls,</span>
<span>For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.</span>
<span>You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.</span>
<span>For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.</span>
<span>You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.</span>
<span>The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.</span>
<span>Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;</span>
<span>For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.</span>
