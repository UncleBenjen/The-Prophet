<span>And one of the elders of the city said, "Speak to us of Good and Evil."</span>
<span>And he answered:</span>
<span>Of the good in you I can speak, but not of the evil.</span>
<span>For what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger and thirst?</span>
<span>Verily when good is hungry it seeks food even in dark caves, and when it thirsts, it drinks even of dead waters.</span>
<span>You are good when you are one with yourself.</span>
<span>Yet when you are not one with yourself you are not evil.</span>
<span>For a divided house is not a den of thieves; it is only a divided house.</span>
<span>And a ship without rudder may wander aimlessly among perilous isles yet sink not to the bottom.</span>
<span>You are good when you strive to give of yourself.</span>
<span>Yet you are not evil when you seek gain for yourself.</span>
<span>For when you strive for gain you are but a root that clings to the earth and sucks at her breast.</span>
<span>Surely the fruit cannot say to the root, "Be like me, ripe and full and ever giving of your abundance."</span>
<span>For to the fruit giving is a need, as receiving is a need to the root.</span>
<span>You are good when you are fully awake in your speech,</span>
<span>Yet you are not evil when you sleep while your tongue staggers without purpose.</span>
<span>And even stumbling speech may strengthen a weak tongue.</span>
<span>You are good when you walk to your goal firmly and with bold steps.</span>
<span>Yet you are not evil when you go thither limping.</span>
<span>Even those who limp go not backward.</span>
<span>But you who are strong and swift, see that you do not limp before the lame, deeming it kindness.</span>
<span>You are good in countless ways, and you are not evil when you are not good,</span>
<span>You are only loitering and sluggard.</span>
<span>Pity that the stags cannot teach swiftness to the turtles.</span>
<span>In your longing for your giant self lies your goodness: and that longing is in all of you.</span>
<span>But in some of you that longing is a torrent rushing with might to the sea, carrying the secrets of the hillsides and the songs of the forest.</span>
<span>And in others it is a flat stream that loses itself in angles and bends and lingers before it reaches the shore.</span>
<span>But let not him who longs much say to him who longs little, "Wherefore are you slow and halting?"</span>
<span>For the truly good ask not the naked, "Where is your garment?" nor the houseless, "What has befallen your house?"</span>
