<span>And a man said, "Speak to us of Self-Knowledge."</span>
<span>And he answered, saying:</span>
<span>Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.</span>
<span>But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart's knowledge.</span>
<span>You would know in words that which you have always known in thought.</span>
<span>You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.</span>
<span>And it is well you should.</span>
<span>The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea;</span>
<span>And the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.</span>
<span>But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;</span>
<span>And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.</span>
<span>For self is a sea boundless and measureless.</span>
<span>Say not, "I have found the truth," but rather, "I have found a truth."</span>
<span>Say not, "I have found the path of the soul." Say rather, "I have met the soul walking upon my path."</span>
<span>For the soul walks upon all paths.</span>
<span>The soul walks not upon a line, neither does it grow like a reed.</span>
<span>The soul unfolds itself, like a lotus of countless petals.</span>
