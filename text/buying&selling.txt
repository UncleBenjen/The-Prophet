<span>And a merchant said, "Speak to us of Buying and Selling."</span>
<span>And he answered and said:</span>
<span>To you the earth yields her fruit, and you shall not want if you but know how to fill your hands.</span>
<span>It is in exchanging the gifts of the earth that you shall find abundance and be satisfied.</span>
<span>Yet unless the exchange be in love and kindly justice, it will but lead some to greed and others to hunger.</span>
<span>When in the market place you toilers of the sea and fields and vineyards meet the weavers and the potters and the gatherers of spices, -</span>
<span>Invoke then the master spirit of the earth, to come into your midst and sanctify the scales and the reckoning that weighs value against value.</span>
<span>And suffer not the barren-handed to take part in your transactions, who would sell their words for your labour.</span>
<span>To such men you should say,</span>
<span>"Come with us to the field, or go with our brothers to the sea and cast your net;</span>
<span>For the land and the sea shall be bountiful to you even as to us."</span>
<span>And if there come the singers and the dancers and the flute players, - buy of their gifts also.</span>
<span>For they too are gatherers of fruit and frankincense, and that which they bring, though fashioned of dreams, is raiment and food for your soul.</span>
<span>And before you leave the marketplace, see that no one has gone his way with empty hands.</span>
<span>For the master spirit of the earth shall not sleep peacefully upon the wind till the needs of the least of you are satisfied.</span>
