<span>And then a scholar said, "Speak of Talking."</span>
<span>And he answered, saying:</span>
<span>You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts;</span>
<span>And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime.</span>
<span>And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered.</span>
<span>For thought is a bird of space, that in a cage of words many indeed unfold its wings but cannot fly.</span>
<span>There are those among you who seek the talkative through fear of being alone.</span>
<span>The silence of aloneness reveals to their eyes their naked selves and they would escape.</span>
<span>And there are those who talk, and without knowledge or forethought reveal a truth which they themselves do not understand.</span>
<span>And there are those who have the truth within them, but they tell it not in words.</span>
<span>In the bosom of such as these the spirit dwells in rhythmic silence.</span>
<span>When you meet your friend on the roadside or in the market place, let the spirit in you move your lips and direct your tongue.</span>
<span>Let the voice within your voice speak to the ear of his ear;</span>
<span>For his soul will keep the truth of your heart as the taste of the wine is remembered</span>
<span>When the colour is forgotten and the vessel is no more.</span>
