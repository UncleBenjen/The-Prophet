<span>And an old priest said, "Speak to us of Religion."</span>
<span>And he said:</span>
<span>Have I spoken this day of aught else?</span>
<span>Is not religion all deeds and all reflection,</span>
<span>And that which is neither deed nor reflection, but a wonder and a surprise ever springing in the soul, even while the hands hew the stone or tend the loom?</span>
<span>Who can separate his faith from his actions, or his belief from his occupations?</span>
<span>Who can spread his hours before him, saying, "This for God and this for myself; This for my soul, and this other for my body?"</span>
<span>All your hours are wings that beat through space from self to self.</span>
<span>He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.</span>
<span>The wind and the sun will tear no holes in his skin.</span>
<span>And he who defines his conduct by ethics imprisons his song-bird in a cage.</span>
<span>The freest song comes not through bars and wires.</span>
<span>And he to whom worshipping is a window, to open but also to shut, has not yet visited the house of his soul whose windows are from dawn to dawn.</span>
<span>Your daily life is your temple and your religion.</span>
<span>Whenever you enter into it take with you your all.</span>
<span>Take the plough and the forge and the mallet and the lute,</span>
<span>The things you have fashioned in necessity or for delight.</span>
<span>For in reverie you cannot rise above your achievements nor fall lower than your failures.</span>
<span>And take with you all men:</span>
<span>For in adoration you cannot fly higher than their hopes nor humble yourself lower than their despair.</span>
<span>And if you would know God be not therefore a solver of riddles.</span>
<span>Rather look about you and you shall see Him playing with your children.</span>
<span>And look into space; you shall see Him walking in the cloud, outstretching His arms in the lightning and descending in rain.</span>
<span>You shall see Him smiling in flowers, then rising and waving His hands in trees.</span>
