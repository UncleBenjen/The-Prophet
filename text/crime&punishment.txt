<span>Then one of the judges of the city stood forth and said, "Speak to us of Crime and Punishment."</span>
<span>And he answered saying:</span>
<span>It is when your spirit goes wandering upon the wind,</span>
<span>That you, alone and unguarded, commit a wrong unto others and therefore unto yourself.</span>
<span>And for that wrong committed must you knock and wait a while unheeded at the gate of the blessed.</span>
<span>Like the ocean is your god-self;</span>
<span>It remains for ever undefiled.</span>
<span>And like the ether it lifts but the winged.</span>
<span>Even like the sun is your god-self;</span>
<span>It knows not the ways of the mole nor seeks it the holes of the serpent.</span>
<span>But your god-self does not dwell alone in your being.</span>
<span>Much in you is still man, and much in you is not yet man,</span>
<span>But a shapeless pigmy that walks asleep in the mist searching for its own awakening.</span>
<span>And of the man in you would I now speak.</span>
<span>For it is he and not your god-self nor the pigmy in the mist, that knows crime and the punishment of crime.</span>
<span>Oftentimes have I heard you speak of one who commits a wrong as though he were not one of you, but a stranger unto you and an intruder upon your world.</span>
<span>But I say that even as the holy and the righteous cannot rise beyond the highest which is in each one of you,</span>
<span>So the wicked and the weak cannot fall lower than the lowest which is in you also.</span>
<span>And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree,</span>
<span>So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.</span>
<span>Like a procession you walk together towards your god-self.</span>
<span>You are the way and the wayfarers.</span>
<span>And when one of you falls down he falls for those behind him, a caution against the stumbling stone.</span>
<span>Ay, and he falls for those ahead of him, who though faster and surer of foot, yet removed not the stumbling stone.</span>
<span>And this also, though the word lie heavy upon your hearts:</span>
<span>The murdered is not unaccountable for his own murder,</span>
<span>And the robbed is not blameless in being robbed.</span>
<span>The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked,</span>
<span>And the white-handed is not clean in the doings of the felon.</span>
<span>Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured,</span>
<span>And still more often the condemned is the burden-bearer for the guiltless and unblamed.</span>
<span>You cannot separate the just from the unjust and the good from the wicked;</span>
<span>For they stand together before the face of the sun even as the black thread and the white are woven together.</span>
<span>And when the black thread breaks, the weaver shall look into the whole cloth, and he shall examine the loom also.</span>
<span>If any of you would bring to judgment the unfaithful wife,</span>
<span>Let him also weigh the heart of her husband in scales, and measure his soul with measurements.</span>
<span>And let him who would lash the offender look unto the spirit of the offended.</span>
<span>And if any of you would punish in the name of righteousness and lay the axe unto the evil tree, let him see to its roots;</span>
<span>And verily he will find the roots of the good and the bad, the fruitful and the fruitless, all entwined together in the silent heart of the earth.</span>
<span>And you judges who would be just,</span>
<span>What judgment pronounce you upon him who though honest in the flesh yet is a thief in spirit?</span>
<span>What penalty lay you upon him who slays in the flesh yet is himself slain in the spirit?</span>
<span>And how prosecute you him who in action is a deceiver and an oppressor,</span>
<span>Yet who also is aggrieved and outraged?</span>
<span>And how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than their misdeeds?</span>
<span>Is not remorse the justice which is administered by that very law which you would fain serve?</span>
<span>Yet you cannot lay remorse upon the innocent nor lift it from the heart of the guilty.</span>
<span>Unbidden shall it call in the night, that men may wake and gaze upon themselves.</span>
<span>And you who would understand justice, how shall you unless you look upon all deeds in the fullness of light?</span>
<span>Only then shall you know that the erect and the fallen are but one man standing in twilight between the night of his pigmy-self and the day of his god-self,</span>
<span>And that the corner-stone of the temple is not higher than the lowest stone in its foundation.</span>
