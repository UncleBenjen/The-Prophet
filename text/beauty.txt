<span>And a poet said, "Speak to us of Beauty."</span>
<span>Where shall you seek beauty, and how shall you find her unless she herself be your way and your guide?</span>
<span>And how shall you speak of her except she be the weaver of your speech?</span>
<span>The aggrieved and the injured say, "Beauty is kind and gentle.</span>
<span>Like a young mother half-shy of her own glory she walks among us."</span>
<span>And the passionate say, "Nay, beauty is a thing of might and dread.</span>
<span>Like the tempest she shakes the earth beneath us and the sky above us."</span>
<span>The tired and the weary say, "Beauty is of soft whisperings. She speaks in our spirit.</span>
<span>Her voice yields to our silences like a faint light that quivers in fear of the shadow."</span>
<span>But the restless say, "We have heard her shouting among the mountains,</span>
<span>And with her cries came the sound of hoofs, and the beating of wings and the roaring of lions."</span>
<span>At night the watchmen of the city say, "Beauty shall rise with the dawn from the east."</span>
<span>And at noontide the toilers and the wayfarers say, "We have seen her leaning over the earth from the windows of the sunset."</span>
<span>In winter say the snow-bound, "She shall come with the spring leaping upon the hills."</span>
<span>And in the summer heat the reapers say, "We have seen her dancing with the autumn leaves, and we saw a drift of snow in her hair."</span>
<span>All these things have you said of beauty.</span>
<span>Yet in truth you spoke not of her but of needs unsatisfied,</span>
<span>And beauty is not a need but an ecstasy.</span>
<span>It is not a mouth thirsting nor an empty hand stretched forth,</span>
<span>But rather a heart enflamed and a soul enchanted.</span>
<span>It is not the image you would see nor the song you would hear,</span>
<span>But rather an image you see though you close your eyes and a song you hear though you shut your ears.</span>
<span>It is not the sap within the furrowed bark, nor a wing attached to a claw,</span>
<span>But rather a garden for ever in bloom and a flock of angels for ever in flight.</span>
<span>People of Orphalese, beauty is life when life unveils her holy face.</span>
<span>But you are life and you are the veil.</span>
<span>Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror.</span>
<span>But you are eternity and you are the mirror.</span>
