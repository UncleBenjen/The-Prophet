<span>Then a hermit, who visited the city once a year, came forth and said, "Speak to us of Pleasure."</span>
<span>And he answered, saying:</span>
<span>Pleasure is a freedom song,</span>
<span>But it is not freedom.</span>
<span>It is the blossoming of your desires,</span>
<span>But it is not their fruit.</span>
<span>It is a depth calling unto a height,</span>
<span>But it is not the deep nor the high.</span>
<span>It is the caged taking wing,</span>
<span>But it is not space encompassed.</span>
<span>Ay, in very truth, pleasure is a freedom-song.</span>
<span>And I fain would have you sing it with fullness of heart; yet I would not have you lose your hearts in the singing.</span>
<span>Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are judged and rebuked.</span>
<span>I would not judge nor rebuke them. I would have them seek.</span>
<span>For they shall find pleasure, but not her alone:</span>
<span>Seven are her sisters, and the least of them is more beautiful than pleasure.</span>
<span>Have you not heard of the man who was digging in the earth for roots and found a treasure?</span>
<span>And some of your elders remember pleasures with regret like wrongs committed in drunkenness.</span>
<span>But regret is the beclouding of the mind and not its chastisement.</span>
<span>They should remember their pleasures with gratitude, as they would the harvest of a summer.</span>
<span>Yet if it comforts them to regret, let them be comforted.</span>
<span>And there are among you those who are neither young to seek nor old to remember;</span>
<span>And in their fear of seeking and remembering they shun all pleasures, lest they neglect the spirit or offend against it.</span>
<span>But even in their foregoing is their pleasure.</span>
<span>And thus they too find a treasure though they dig for roots with quivering hands.</span>
<span>But tell me, who is he that can offend the spirit?</span>
<span>Shall the nightingale offend the stillness of the night, or the firefly the stars?</span>
<span>And shall your flame or your smoke burden the wind?</span>
<span>Think you the spirit is a still pool which you can trouble with a staff?</span>
<span>Oftentimes in denying yourself pleasure you do but store the desire in the recesses of your being.</span>
<span>Who knows but that which seems omitted today, waits for tomorrow?</span>
<span>Even your body knows its heritage and its rightful need and will not be deceived.</span>
<span>And your body is the harp of your soul,</span>
<span>And it is yours to bring forth sweet music from it or confused sounds.</span>
<span>And now you ask in your heart, "How shall we distinguish that which is good in pleasure from that which is not good?"</span>
<span>Go to your fields and your gardens, and you shall learn that it is the pleasure of the bee to gather honey of the flower,</span>
<span>But it is also the pleasure of the flower to yield its honey to the bee.</span>
<span>For to the bee a flower is a fountain of life,</span>
<span>And to the flower a bee is a messenger of love,</span>
<span>And to both, bee and flower, the giving and the receiving of pleasure is a need and an ecstasy.</span>
<span>People of Orphalese, be in your pleasures like the flowers and the bees.</span>
