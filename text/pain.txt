<span>And a woman spoke, saying, "Tell us of Pain."</span>
<span>And he said:</span>
<span>Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.</span>
<span>Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.</span>
<span>And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy;</span>
<span>And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields.</span>
<span>And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief.</span>
<span>Much of your pain is self-chosen.</span>
<span>It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.</span>
<span>Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquillity:</span>
<span>For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen,</span>
<span>And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears.</span>
