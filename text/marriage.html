<h4>Marriage</h4>
<p>Then Almitra spoke again and said, "And what of Marriage, master?"<br>
And he answered saying:<br>
You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.<br>
You shall be together when white wings of death scatter your days.<br>
Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.<br>
But let there be spaces in your togetherness,<br>
And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.<br>
Love one another but make not a bond of love:<br>
Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.<br>
Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.<br>
Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.<br>
Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,<br>
Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.<br>
Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.<br>
For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.<br>
And stand together, yet not too near together:<br>
For the pillars of the temple stand apart,<br>
And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.<br>
